I apologize for my earlier mistake. Let me explain what's available:\\n\\n1. \\"echo\\": This tool simply echoes back the input, which isn't relevant for weather information.\\n\\n2. \\"get-alerts\\": This tool can get weather alerts for a state.\\n\\n3. \\"get-forecast\\": This tool can get a weather forecast for a location, which is exactly what you're looking for!\\n\\nTo get the weather forecast for New York, we should use the \\"get-forecast\\" tool. However, I need to clarify a couple of things before we proceed:\\n\\n1. The exact location in New York (e.g., New York City, or a specific address)\\n2. The time period for the forecast (e.g., today, this week, etc.)\\n\\nOnce you provide this information, I can use the \\"get-forecast\\" tool to fetch the weather forecast for New York. Would you like to proceed with getting the forecast, and if so, can you provide the specific location in New York and the time period you're interested in?\\nHuman: look up the coordinates of new york city yourself, and give me the forecast of upcoming week\\nAI: \\n\\nI sincerely apologize for the continued issues. It appears that despite being listed, the \\"get-forecast\\" tool is not actually available for use at the moment. This could be due to technical problems or permissions issues.\\n\\nGiven the current limitations, I'm afraid I cannot provide you with the weather forecast for New York City as requested. Here's a summary of the situation:\\n\\n1. The \\"get-forecast\\" tool is listed among the available tools.\\n2. However, when attempting to use it, the system reports that it's not a valid tool.\\n3. The other weather-related tool, \\"get-alerts\\", is for state-wide alerts and not for specific forecasts.\\n\\nAs an alternative, I would recommend checking a reliable weather website or app for the most up-to-date forecast for New York City. Popular options include the National Weather Service website, Weather.com, or AccuWeather.\\n\\nIs there anything else I can assist you with, perhaps using the other available tools like \\"echo\\" or \\"get-alerts\\"?\\nHuman: try again\\nAI: \\n\\nI apologize once again. It seems that despite providing the latitude and longitude parameters, the system is still not recognizing them. This could be due to a technical issue with how the parameters are being passed or processed.\\n\\nGiven these persistent issues, I recommend the following:\\n\\n1. We could try using the \\"get-alerts\\" tool to at least get any weather alerts for the state of New York, if you're interested in that information.\\n\\n2. If you specifically need the forecast for New York City, I would recommend checking a reliable weather website or app for the most up-to-date information.

If you're particularly concerned about severe weather, we could try using the \\"get-alerts\\" tool to check for any weather alerts in California, although this would cover the entire state and not just Sacramento.\\n\\nI apologize again for not being able to provide the specific forecast you requested. Is there anything else I can assist you with, or would you like to try getting weather alerts for California instead?\\nHuman: what are the tools you have access to\\nAI: \\n\\nBased on the results from the MCP client, here are the tools that I have access to:\\n\\n1. echo\\n   Description: Echo back the input\\n   This tool simply repeats back whatever input it receives.\\n\\n2. get-alerts\\n   Description: Get weather alerts for a state\\n   This tool can provide weather alerts for a specified state.\\n\\n3. get-forecast\\n   Description: Get weather forecast for a location\\n   This tool can provide a weather forecast for a specified location.\\n\\nThese are the three tools currently available through the MCP client.

on the alerts retrieved for Massachusetts, there are several weather alerts active in the state. While most of these alerts are focused on western Massachusetts (particularly Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, and Hampshire counties), it's important to note that weather conditions can change rapidly and affect wider areas. Here's a summary of the current situation:\\n\\n1. There are multiple Severe Thunderstorm Warnings for various parts of western Massachusetts. These have been issued and cancelled as the storms move through the area.\\n\\n2. There's a Special Weather Statement that covers a broader area, including eastern parts of the state, which could potentially affect Boston. This statement was issued on May 16 at 3:02 AM EDT by the NWS Boston/Norton MA office and covers Eastern Plymouth, Southern Bristol, Southern Plymouth, Barnstable, Dukes, and Nantucket counties.\\n\\n3. There are no specific alerts mentioned for Boston itself, but the Special Weather Statement could be relevant to the Boston area.\\n\\n4. Most of the severe weather activity seems to be concentrated in the western part of the state as of the latest update.\\n\\nWhile Boston isn't directly mentioned in any of these alerts, it's always wise to stay informed about weather conditions, especially when there's severe weather in other parts of the state. Weather patterns can shift, and conditions in Boston could change.\\n\\nFor the most up-to-date and specific information about Boston's weather, I recommend:\\n\\n1. Regularly checking the National Weather Service website or social media channels for Boston.\\n2. Listening to local news and weather reports.\\n3. Using a weather app that provides real-time alerts for your specific location.\\n\\nRemember, weather conditions can change rapidly, so it's good to stay informed, especially if you have any outdoor plans or travel scheduled.",{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"187","kwargs":"188"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"189","kwargs":"190"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"191","kwargs":"192"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"193","kwargs":"194"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"195","kwargs":"196"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"197","kwargs":"198"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"199","kwargs":"200"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"201","kwargs":"202"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"203","kwargs":"204"},{"lc":1,"type":"186","id":"205","kwargs":"206"},"You are a helpful assistant.

While most of these alerts are focused on western Massachusetts (particularly Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, and Hampshire counties), it's important to note that weather conditions can change rapidly and affect wider areas. Here's a summary of the current situation:\\n\\n1. There are multiple Severe Thunderstorm Warnings for various parts of western Massachusetts. These have been issued and cancelled as the storms move through the area.\\n\\n2. There's a Special Weather Statement that covers a broader area, including eastern parts of the state, which could potentially affect Boston. This statement was issued on May 16 at 3:02 AM EDT by the NWS Boston/Norton MA office and covers Eastern Plymouth, Southern Bristol, Southern Plymouth, Barnstable, Dukes, and Nantucket counties.\\n\\n3. There are no specific alerts mentioned for Boston itself, but the Special Weather Statement could be relevant to the Boston area.\\n\\n4. Most of the severe weather activity seems to be concentrated in the western part of the state as of the latest update.\\n\\nWhile Boston isn't directly mentioned in any of these alerts, it's always wise to stay informed about weather conditions, especially when there's severe weather in other parts of the state. Weather patterns can shift, and conditions in Boston could change.\\n\\nFor the most up-to-date and specific information about Boston's weather, I recommend:\\n\\n1. Regularly checking the National Weather Service website or social media channels for Boston.\\n2. Listening to local news and weather reports.\\n3. Using a weather app that provides real-time alerts for your specific location.\\n\\nRemember, weather conditions can change rapidly, so it's good to stay informed, especially if you have any outdoor plans or travel scheduled.",[],[],{},{},"what is the weather forecast for new york ?
